You can transfer different colored water from one glass to another only if the other glass is empty or if the top layer of water is the same color as the glass from which the water will be taken. The glass you selected will be highlighted to prevent confusion. The restart button will take you back to the beginning of the level, and also every time you unlock the same level, the water will be mixed.
